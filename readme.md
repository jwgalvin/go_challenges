Challenges done in go

structs are similar to hashes in ruby.


"*" in front a type description
"*" this transforms pointer to value

if you have an address you can convert it to a value with "*address"
if you have a value you can turn it into an address with "&value"


GO has reference types and value types of data. reference types don't need pointers. They include,
slices, maps, channels, pointers, and functions.
